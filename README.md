## What this project will contain

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `simulation/` | Simulink model (`.slx`) and PNG figure comparing PID vs FL (sim). |
| `firmware/`   | `pid_controller.ino` (tested) and `fl_controller_stub.ino` (law ready, sensor TBD). |
| `hardware/`   | Photo of the rig and STEP file of the beam (based on open-source CAD, CC-BY-SA). |
| `media/`      | 15-s video of the PID tracking a step at the center set-point. |
| `fig/`        | Plots autogenerated from simulation / experiments. |
| `data/`       | CSV logs (time, x, Î¸, u) for reproducibility. |

## Road-map

- **08 Jul 2025**  Repo skeleton (this README).
- **14 Jul 2025**  Upload photo, PID video, Simulink model + comparison plot.
- **Mid Jul 2025**  Add Arduino firmware (PID + FL stub) and logged data.
- **Late Jul 2025**  Integrate MPU-6050 IMU â†’ validate feedback-linearization on hardware.
- **Aug 2025**  Release short 4-page technical note + backstepping baseline.

Stay tuned!
